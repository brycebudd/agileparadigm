# The Core Concept: Beyond a Single Point of Failure
<!-- (Kent Beck's Style) Frame the problem in human terms. We aren't just solving a technical problem; we're protecting our users and our on-call engineers from outages. -->

For years, our standard has been a single, regional GKE cluster serving traffic. This model is simple, but it carries a silent, significant risk: a full regional outage, whether from a GCP incident or a failed deployment, takes our entire application offline. This not only impacts our users but also places an immense burden on the on-call team during a crisis.

The move to a multi-cluster architecture, orchestrated by Multi-Cluster Ingress (MCI), is our answer to this problem. It represents a fundamental shift from treating a cluster as a pet to treating our application as a single, globally resilient entity. This document explains the architecture, the trade-offs, and the principles behind this powerful pattern.

# How Multi-Cluster Ingress Works: A Mental Model
<!-- (Gregor Hohpe's Style) Use a structured, pattern-based explanation with diagrams to create a clear mental model of the system. -->

At its heart, Multi-Cluster Ingress is a control plane that programs the **Google Cloud External HTTP(S) Load Balancer** to route traffic to services running in multiple GKE clusters across different regions. It is not a data plane itself; the actual traffic flows through Google's battle-tested global network edge.

A central "Config Cluster" is designated to host the `MultiClusterIngress` and `MultiClusterService` CRDs. This cluster acts as the single source of truth for the global ingress configuration.

The flow is as follows:

1. An engineer defines a `MultiClusterIngress` resource on the Config Cluster, pointing to one or more `MultiClusterService` resources.

2. The MCI controller observes these resources.

3. It discovers the GKE clusters that are members of the "Fleet" (formerly known as an Environ).

4. It identifies the backend services (matching the MultiClusterService definition) within each member cluster. These become the Backend Services for the load balancer.

5. The controller programs the Global External Load Balancer with the correct forwarding rules, health checks, and backend service configurations.

6. User traffic hits a single global Anycast IP address, is routed to the nearest healthy Google Front End (GFE), and then directed to the closest, healthiest GKE cluster with available capacity.

# Key Principles and Trade-offs
<!-- (Martin Fowler's Style) Be pragmatic. This isn't magic. Discuss the real-world trade-offs and nuances. -->

Adopting MCI is not free. It introduces new complexities that we must manage deliberately.

|Principle/Feature|Benefit|Trade-off / Consideration|
|---|---|---|
|**Global Resiliency**|Survive a full regional GKE outage with automated traffic failover.|Increased cost due to running active-active clusters. Requires careful capacity planning.|
|**Low-Latency Routing**|Users are routed to the geographically closest cluster.|Data locality and replication become critical. A user in Europe writing data to a US cluster can introduce latency.|
|**Centralized Config**|A single manifest in the Config Cluster controls global traffic.|The Config Cluster becomes a Tier-0 dependency. Its availability is critical for making routing changes (though not for existing traffic flow).|
|**Decoupled Deployments**|New application versions can be rolled out to a single cluster first.|Requires sophisticated CI/CD that is Fleet-aware to manage multi-cluster deployments safely.|

The Craftsman's View: Our Rules of Engagement
<!-- (Robert C. Martin's Style) Conclude with a strong, prescriptive set of principles. This isn't just a pattern; it's our standard of professional practice. -->

This architecture is powerful, but power requires discipline. To ensure we use MCI effectively and safely, our team adheres to the following principles:

1. **Automate Everything**: All MCI and MCS resources must be managed via our GitOps CI/CD pipeline. No manual `kubectl apply` commands are permitted against the Config Cluster.

2. **Health Checks are Non-Negotiable**: Every backend service exposed via MCI must have a meaningful `/healthz` endpoint that accurately reflects its ability to serve traffic. A simple `200 OK` is not enough.

3. **Plan for Data Gravity**: For stateful services, MCI is only one part of the solution. A corresponding global data replication strategy (e.g., using Spanner or cross-region database replicas) must be designed and approved alongside the network architecture.

4. **The Config Cluster is Sacred**: The Config Cluster is for configuration only. It will not run user-facing workloads. Access to it is strictly limited.

By adopting these rules, we ensure that our global architecture provides the resilience we need without introducing unnecessary risk or operational chaos.
